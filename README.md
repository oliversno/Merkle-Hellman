# Disclaimer: Only use state of the art cryptography code written by experts. Never use code that you wrote yourself (unless you are a published expert in the field) or was written by a random person online. It isn't secure. Especially don't use this because the algorithm considered secure since the 80s.

Merkle-Hellman is an early public-key cryptography system based the subset-sum problem (which is a special case of the general knapsack problem). It was borken in 1984 by Adi Shamir.
